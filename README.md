Home on Time is a powerful safety app developed during the Power Hack, organized by SheCanCode at Dojo, with a primary focus on improving women's safety. The app provides users with a reliable way to notify their chosen contact when they expect to arrive home safely, based on their estimated time of arrival. Moreover, if the user fails to reach their destination within the specified time, Home on Time will automatically trigger an SOS message in the form of a text to the selected contact, ensuring that help is provided promptly.

This project was created through the collaborative efforts of a skilled and diverse group of developers, including [Rachel Newby](https://github.com/rachelnewby), [Sonia Botsarova](https://github.com/sonianb), [Amy Kuner](https://github.com/amykuner), [Justyna Luberda](https://github.com/JLoobs) and [Amina Ba](https://github.com/xamiba). Our cohesive team utilized a mix of full-stack and front-end development expertise to craft a solution that addresses a significant societal concern.
